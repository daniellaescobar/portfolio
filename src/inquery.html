        <h4>What Inquery Means to Me</h4>
        <p>
          The idea for Inquery came from a course at my university that was
          created for students studying computer science and business where they
          would get paired into groups and find insights from various datasets.
          Throughout COVID, one of the students' parents owned their own coffee
          shop and were willing to provide their data so that the class could
          provide them with business insights to help them cut costs during such
          a difficult time. The students were able to provide recommendations
          for the shop, such as closing during certain hours, removing specific
          items from their menu, and strategic discounts. With my parents as
          small business owners, I was motivated to design Inquery as a way I
          saw for both sides to benefit from each other's help.

          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            Many small businesses don’t have the time, resources, or knowledge
            to become a data driven organization. Data scientists can help these
            smaller businesses find insights in their data, but they need a way
            to connect with each other
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Provide small business owners with a personalized job board to
            connect with data scientists so they can improve their business
            model and provide relevant experience to both data science students
            and professionals

      <div class="research">
        <h4>User Research: Summary</h4>
        <p>
          Our initial idea was to design an app that would budget our users'
          money, but after speaking with college students, we realized that we
          weren't seeing many commonalities in how people currently tracked
          their money or what they wanted out of an app, a budgeting feature
          included. Our solution was to design a simple spending tracker that
          would be flexible to user needs and ultimately teach financial and
          spending awareness.

          By evaluating our competitors and comparing that analysis to our user
          interviews, we determined that crucial features of Inquery would be
          the ability to quickly scan an applicant’s qualifications and job
          preferences from their profile, providing scannable job details,
          notifying an applicant if their application has been viewed, and
          giving status indicators to employers so they can keep track of new
          applicants.

        <h4>Information Architecture</h4>

          Since there are four types of users for our site, we divided our IA
          into the view for a data scientist (once they have created an account)
          and the view for a small business owner. The main difference is how
          either user would interact with the job/applicant search.

        <br />
        <p>
          After setting up the app, they can view their overall spending on the
          dashboard, view a list of their transactions, and sort them with the
          Inbox.

          scientist could be messaged from, a search bar for a user's top
          recommended profiles, and an about page where small business owners
          could learn about the value of hiring a data scientist.

          Our wireframes highlighted the primary user flows of 1) locating a job
          and applying to it and 2) monitoring your applicants and ensuring they
          are qualified for the job. A prominent feature that ultimately made it
          to the digital wireframes was a chat screen where employers and
          applicants can easily message and schedule zoom meetings. This
          remedied a shared user paint point between the two of a lack of timely
          and proper communication.

          Our users highlighted multiple areas of improvement, such as
          streamlining the process of applying to a job and increasing
          communication between applicants and employers. To accommodate those
          pain points, we redesigned some of our panels with additional
          features.

        <div class="redesigned-one">
          <p>#1 - Indicate if a company is actively looking for hires</p>

        </div>
        <div class="redesigned-two">
          <p>
            #2 - Have a shortcut to apply to a job posting from the businesses’
            profile instead of first clicking on the position description to be
            able to apply

          Out of the 4 tasks we asked our users to complete, all 6 users were
          able to complete all 4 tasks and 100% of users said they would use
          this site.

              “I thought it was easy to find where I can view people that
              applied to my job posting since it is located on the navigation
              bar and the title "My applicants" is pretty straightforward.”

              “I didn't necessarily think anything was missing or overwhelming.
              I especially liked the different categories a company or business
              owner can look for potential candidates.”
