        <h4>What Centible Means to Me</h4>
        <p>
          During the spring 2022 semester, the UNC-Chapel Hill Computer Science
          Department planned to have their first ever "App-A-Thon" in April
          where students could submit a fully designed and developed app to be
          enter into their contest. After brainstorming ideas, we decided to
          build an app focused on financial awareness for college students. Most
          college students struggle with a consistent way to keep track of their
          money -- our team included -- so we thought Centible would be
          beneficial not only to ourselves, but to anyone who needs help keeping
          track of where their money goes. Our app ended up winning a total of
          $500 from the contest for "Best App" and "Best Functionality," which
          will most likely go towards funding our API for future users!

          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            College students have a difficult time sticking to their current
            budgeting apps because there are too many complex and distracting
            features.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Create a simplified spending tracker that builds financial awareness
            by helping users understand where their money is going.

        <h4>User Research: Summary</h4>
        <p>
          Our initial idea was to design an app that would budget our users'
          money, but after speaking with college students, we realized that we
          weren't seeing many commonalities in how people currently tracked
          their money or what they wanted out of an app, a budgeting feature
          included. Our solution was to design a simple spending tracker that
          would be flexible to user needs and ultimately teach financial and
          spending awareness.

          The top 4 apps our college students reported using were Mint,
          Truebill, Fudget, and Goodbudget, so we decided to include them in our
          competitor analysis. Two of these apps automatically sort purchases
          but have more complex features that distracted users. The other two
          require the user to manually type in every transaction, which users
          did not like.

          We wanted the app to have a simple user flow so that users could focus
          on tracking their current spending. During onboarding, they are
          welcomed, set up their banking information through Plaid, and select
          which categories they would like to have.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After setting up the app, they can view their overall spending on the
          dashboard, view a list of their transactions, and sort them with the
          Inbox.

      <div class="sketches">
        <h4>Sketches</h4>
        <p>
          Since this app required so few screens, we decided to sketch out and
          build multiple ideas to share with the rest of the team so we could
          fine-tune which features we thought would work best with users.
          Initial sketches included a drag and drop sort feature, a line versus
          bar graph for the home screen, and a quick sort feature from the
          transactions page where users would sort individual transactions.
        </p>

            alt="An iteration of Centible"
          />
          <p>
            Initially, we thought it would be most intuitive for users to sort
            their transactions as they appeared on their transactions list by
            using a swiping gesture. We recieved feedback that this was not an
            intuitive way to sort, however, so we opted for separating the
            sorting feature into an additional screen.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="iteration-two">
          <p>
            We figured that users would inevitably make mistakes while sorting,
            so we designed a quick way to correct sorting by scrolling to select
            which icon the transaction belonged to. After consideration, we
            realized it may be difficult on this screen for users to
            differentiate categories without text as a confirmation.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./img/iteration-two-centible.png"

          <p>
            It took us multiple designs to finalize the inbox where users would
            sort their transactions. To show users how many transactions they
            had to go, we considered stacking them and including icons to
            streamline the process. We decided afterwards that more information
            should be displayed with each transaction.
