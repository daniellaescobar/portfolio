        <h4>What Bubbly Means to Me</h4>
        <p>
          As App Team Carolina's first project, Bubbly was an especially
          exciting and challenging app because we would be designing for
          students with a visual impairment that no one on my team had
          previously known about. This iPad app was created as an interactive
          game for young students with Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) to help
          them improve their condition. Since our team was unable to usability
          test with students, the feedback we've been getting from teachers has
          been all the more meaningful to our team as we see our efforts making
          a real difference in these students' lives.
        </p>

          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            Not many apps exist on the App Store for students with CVI, and due
            to their unique visual needs and often young age, most students with
            CVI cannot access the abundant online literacy resources that are
            available to their sighted peers
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Design an app that allows users with Cortical Visual Impairment
            (CVI) to improve their condition while having fun playing a game
            that our client can use in her classroom. Our app will also help
            younger users learn how to read by catering to the needs of their
            condition

        <p>
          Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) is the most common cause of permanent
          visual impairment in children. It’s most common in babies and young
          children but can continue into adulthood. Although there’s no direct
          cure for CVI, vision rehabilitation can help people with CVI
          significantly improve their vision.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We would be unable to conduct listening sessions or usability tests
          with students because they are generally under the age of 10, but our
          clients are highly qualified to instruct our team as teachers of the
          visually impaired, and one is a Doctoral students at the University of
          Northern Colorado pursing a Ph.D. in Special Education with an
          emphasis on CVI.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When it comes to reading, children with CVI need to be taught to
          understand what they are seeing by highlighting the shape around the
          word. Our game is designed based on the
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >bubble-word strategy</a
          >, which was developed by Dr. Christine Roman-Lantzy. The game will
          task users with dragging and dropping words into their bubbled shapes
          so they can learn to recognize sight words.

            <p>
              <b>Focusing.</b> People with CVI have a difficult time narrowing
              their focus and can become easily distracted by motion, color, and
              sound
            </p>
            <img src="./img/arrow-down-pink.svg" alt="Down arrow" />
            <p>
              <b>Solution:</b> Have intent when using color, sound, and motion
              in a way that isn't aesthetic, but rather draws their attention
              back to the task at hand
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Solution:</b> Not only should the app be switch control
              compatible, but each screen should be laid out in a way that makes
              the vertical and horizontal selections of the control easier. The
              bottom of the app should also have blank space at the bottom to
              accommodate an iPad stand that may cover it

            <p>
              <b>Customizable Settings.</b> Parents and teachers need to be able
              to customize the settings of the app, but students shouldn't be
              able to navigate to those screens. We should try to prevent them
              from ending up there on accident by making them less visable to
              students

            <p>
              <b>Solution:</b> Incorporate a child lock feature and make it so
              that the settings icons easily blend into the background so a
              student isn't likely to click on them

            <p>
              <b>Solution:</b> The app should not include any illustrations,
              rather all images should be of the real thing (like a real picture
              of a cat versus a drawing)

        <p>
          There aren't many preexisting apps for CVI, and the ones that are out
          there lack the setting customization (at least for free) that our
          client needs for her students. Putting a price tag on the features
          also limits more people from benefitting from things like higher
          contrast or sound volume that could mean the different between a
          student being engaged with the app or not. Most importantly, none of
          the apps help with reading ability, just focus.

        <p>
          There are two types of users for our app, either a guardian or a
          student. We want the student to have a seamless and easy experience of
          opening the app and immediately hitting the "play" button to start a
          game with the settings and level pre-selected by a guardian.

          Initial versions of Bubbly were mainly focused on the gameplay itself
          and how best to lay out the screen to be most easily compatible with
          switch controls and limited mobility. We were also concerned with how
          to draw the user's attention back to the screen, opting for a
          combination of sound and motion.

          Our wireframes highlighted the primary user flows of 1) a guardian
          setting up the game for a student and 2) the student playing the game.
          Since we would be sending our wireframes off to clients and
          developers, we made sure to label our CTAs and provide instructions
          for what would happen when a user interacted with each screen.

        <p>
          Since we were unable to conduct usability tests on students, we
          heavily relied on the expertise of our clients during our weekly
          meetings. During our meetings, we would review their written feedback
          on the prototype and ask questions so we could refine our mockups.
          Here is some feedback we received:

          Our clients had many features that they wanted additional
          customization for, notably with the settings. Our app needed to be
          compatible for a variety of users with unique accessibility needs, so
          we added in everything from color customization to a radius of error
          when dragging and dropping a letter. A notable feature was the
          progress bar, which needed to be designed only for guardians to
          interact with.

          Taking into account our information architecture, all portions of the
          app that students are intended to interact with are bright, colorful,
          and obvious, meanwhile parental controls blend into the background
          since they were not intended to stand out to the student.

          Although we were unable to speak with the students personally, a
          developed, interactive version of the app was sent to our client on
          TestFlight, and it has gotten resounding feedback from educators, such
          as:

            <p>
              "I didn't have to teach her the game. She picked it up pretty
              fast. She kept saying after every letter, 'I did it!' "

            <img src="./img/male-user-pink.svg" alt="User" />
            <p>
              "Two pre-school teachers watched my student play the game. They
              loved it and thought this might be something all of their kids
              might be interested in!"

            <img src="./img/female-user-pink.svg" alt="User" />
            <p>
              "I told three of my CVI colleagues about the app and they
              absolutely want to try it with their students."

            <img src="./img/male-user-pink.svg" alt="User" />
            <p>
              "I tried this app with one of my preschoolers who has a diagnosis
              with CVI this week! And she absolutely LOVED it!"

        <h4>Going Forward</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Continue improving version 1 of the app and adding in features such
            as reusable game settings, showing game statistics and history, and
            adding a round timer
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyzing the TestFlight user feedback, fixing bugs, and determining
            which features were a success
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a meeting in the fall with the clients to review the user
            feedback and future features to be added
          </li>
